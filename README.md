# StreamAPI
The explanation and brief look to this powerful tool in Java
✅ What is Stream API?
The Stream API in Java (introduced in Java 8) is a powerful abstraction for processing collections of data in a functional style. It allows you to process data using declarative operations like filter, map, reduce, collect, etc., often using lambdas.

Think of it as a data pipeline:
Collection → Stream → Intermediate Operations → Terminal Operation

✅ Stream API in Simple Terms
Stream is not a data structure. It just processes data from collections.

Streams are lazy. They only process when a terminal operation is called.

Streams do not modify the original collection.
